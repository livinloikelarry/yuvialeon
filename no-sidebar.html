                <h3>Hello, I am Yuvia Leon...</h3>
              </header>
              <p>
                I am a dedicated and driven individual with a passion for
                computer science and a strong commitment to personal and
                professional growth. As a first-generation student, my journey
                has been shaped by the values instilled in me by my family.
                During my formative years in high school, I began to cultivate
                my beliefs and dreams, driven by the principles of hard work,
                resilience, and continuous learning. Raised in an environment
                that celebrated the importance of taking pride in one's work, I
                have consistently embraced challenges as opportunities for
                growth. My profound interest in computer science stems from its
                intricate complexities and detail-oriented nature. I find great
                satisfaction in producing high-quality work and pushing the
                boundaries of what can be achieved through technology.
